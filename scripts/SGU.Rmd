## Background
The Skeptics Guide to the Universe is a weekly podcast hosted by Dr. Steven Novella.  Each week during this segment of the podcast, Dr. Novella presents his panel of skeptics with 3 or 4 science-related news items, 1 of which is fiction.  And each panelist must determine which is the fiction.

## Year End Episode
At the end of the calendar year, Dr. Novella host a year in review episode where the panel reviews their performance at Science or Fiction.  

## 2018 Summary Facts - Episodes #652 - 687 (Beginning of Year Through DragonCon)

* Evan is in the lead this year with the highest overall win percentage, followed by Cara  
* Evan has the most solo wins, followed by Cara.
* Bob's perception that segments with themes are harder isn't true overall but is true for him  
* Cara's performance is much better on segments with themes than without. 
* The panel performs better overall when Cara answers first 
* Relative to other panelists, Bob does well when he is the first to answer.
* There have been 9 panelist sweeps to date (compared to 7 in all of 2017) and 3 hosts sweeps, 1 by Bob and 2 by Steve (Steve had 5 host sweeps last year).
