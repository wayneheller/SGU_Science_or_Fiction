## Background
The Skeptics Guide to the Universe is a weekly podcast hosted by Dr. Steven Novella.  Each week during this segment of the podcast, Dr. Novella presents his panel of skeptics with 3 or 4 science-related news items, 1 of which is fiction.  And each panelist must determine which is the fiction.

## Year End Episode
At the end of the calendar year, Dr. Novella host a year in review episode where the panel reviews their performance at Science or Fiction.
